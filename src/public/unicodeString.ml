(** Signature for Unicode strings.
    {!UText}, {!XString}, {!UTF8}, {!UTF16}, {!UCS4}
    have matched signatures to UStorage
    and satisfy the semantics described below.  If users want to supply
    their own Unicode strings, please design the module with the
    following signature and properties. *)

module type Type = sig
  (** The type of string. *)
  type t

  (** [get t i] : [i]-th character of the storage.*)
  val get : t -> int -> UChar.t

  (** [init len f] creates a new storage.
      the returned storage has length [len], its nth-element is [f n].
      [f] is called with integers [0 ... len - 1], only once for each integer.
      The call is in the increasing order f 0, f 1, f 2, ... *)
  val init : int -> (int -> UChar.t) -> t

  (** The number of Unicode characters in the storage *)
  val length : t -> int

  (** locations in storages.*)
  type index

  (** [look t i] : The character in the location [i] of [t].*)
  val look : t -> index -> UChar.t

  (** [nth t n] : the location of the [n]-th character in [t].*)
  val nth : t -> int -> index

  (** [next x i, prev x i] :
      The operation is valid if [i] points the valid element, i.e. the
      returned value may point the location beyond valid elements by one.
      If [i] does not point a valid element, the results are unspecified. *)

  val next : t -> index -> index
  val prev : t -> index -> index

  (* [out_of_range t i] tests whether [i] is inside of [t]. *)
  val out_of_range : t -> index -> bool
  val iter : (UChar.t -> unit) -> t -> unit

  (* Code point comparison *)
  val compare : t -> t -> int

  (** The location of the first character in the storage. *)
  val first : t -> index

  (** The location of the last character in the storage. *)
  val last : t -> index

  (** [move t i n] :
      if [n] >= 0, then returns [n]-th character after [i] and
      otherwise returns -[n]-th character before [i].
      If there is no such character, or [i] does not point
      a valid character, the result is unspecified. *)
  val move : t -> index -> int -> index

  (** [compare_index t i j] returns
      a positive integer if [i] is the location placed after [j] in [t],
      0 if [i] and [j] point the same location, and
      a negative integer if [i] is the location placed before [j] in [t]. *)
  val compare_index : t -> index -> index -> int

  (** Character buffers.  Similar to Buffer. *)
  module Buf : sig
    type buf

    (** [create n] creates the buffer.  [n] is used to determine
        the initial size of the buffer.  The meaning of [n] differs from
        modules to modules. *)
    val create : int -> buf

    val contents : buf -> t
