(** Module for a Str-like regular expression syntax.
    The difference can be summarised as follows.
    - Non-ASCII characters can be used if encoded by UTF-8, or
    using the escape syntax \u<code number as hex digits>.
    - Each Unicode character is treated as a single character.
    - Character properties like Lu ({!UCharInfo.general_category_type}),
    White_Space ({!UCharInfo.character_property_type}),
    Ogham ({!UCharInfo.script_type}) can be used in character sets. e.g.
    \[\{Lu & ID_Start\}\]\[\{ID_Continue\}\]* (capitalised identifier),
    \(\[\{Han\}\]+\|\[\{Katakana\}\]+\)\[\{Hiragana\}\]*
    (Japanese word component).
    Boolean notations as | (or) :, & (and) - (set subtraction) can be used
    in \{...\} notations.  Any is used to denote the set of all characters
    in \{...\} notations.
