  the new top-level module CamomileDefault, so that linking
  Camomile does not automatically cause to load the data files
  from hard-coded location.  Also, adding new CamomileDyn
  module, which is configured by environmental variables (See
  camomileDynConfig.mli).

* Remove a superfluous check from configure.

0.6.0
-----

* Channel classes confirm common I/O class recommendation
(http://www.ocaml-programming.de/rec/IO-Classes.html) except
non-blocking I/O, which is not supported.

* Remove stdlib replacement introduced in 0.5.*

* UPervasives
  - utf8_*_channel are removed.

  - UChar.uchar_of_int is renamed UChar.of_int

* Locale
  - Locale.current_locale, Locale.set_locale are removed.

* CharEndocing
  - CharEncoding.enc_name is removed.
  - new classes:
	class CharEncoding.convert_uchar_input
	class CharEncoding.convert_uchar_output
	class CharEncoding.convert_input
	class CharEncoding.convert_output

0.5.3
-----

* Fix several bugs in the installation procedure.

* COPYING

* UTF16, UCS4 - improved performance

0.5.0
-----

* Stdlib replacement

* Search string by matching collation

* Binding to ISO C Locale.

* UChar.is_printable

* Locale.current_locale, Locale.set_locale

* CharEncoding.enc_name

* New encoding: iso_c_locale : the encoding specified by the current LC_CTYPE
  locale.

* New encoding: CP932

* Packed and unpacked libraries.

0.4.2
-----

* Add bigarray to the dependency in META.
* Fix a bug in input_line function of ULine.
* Fix a XArray.add_array bug, which affects XString.add_text,
UText.Buf.add_string.
* Make the collator a bit fast.

0.4.1
-----

* CharEndocing
 - The encodings can be referred by IANA names.

* UCol
 - Japanese collation is fully supported (HiraganaQ).
 - Bugs which mainly affect Japanese collation are fixed.
 - generates more compact sort keys.

* ULine
 - Line I/O, and conversion of line separators.

* Data tables are now held through weak pointers, so that they can be
freed during GC.

* All files in charmap directory become optional.  Previously, the build
failed if several charmaps were missing.  In addition, you can remove any
file in the $DATADIR/charmaps and $DATADIR/mappings without causing
run time error.  Of course, this makes some encoding dysfunctional.
Such encodings are treated as non-existent.

0.4.0
-----

* Renamed to Camomile (previously Base)

* USet (Unicode character sets), UCharTbl (fast lookup tables)

* SubText

* URe, UReStr (Regular Expression) are added.

* UTF16, UCS4 (new Unicode string types) are added.

* findlib support

* ocamldoc support

0.3.1
-----

* CharEncoding: Bug fixes for ISO-2022-*

* CharEncoding: Interface for automatic detection of encodings.

* CharEncoding: GB18030 support

* CharEncoding: Improvement of internal data structure (using less space)

* UCol: Incremental comparison

* Performance improvement of collation rule compiler.


0.3.0
-----

* Functor design: API taking Unicode strings becomes functors over Unicode
string implementation. For Unicode strings, UText.t (abstract data type,
internally integer array) and UTF8.t (normal ocaml string with UTF8 encoding)
are currently provided, but suppling another implementation (like wch) should be
easy. For this, API is almost completely revised.

* The locale can be specified for case mapping and string comparison.
