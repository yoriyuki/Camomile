1. Installation

To build and install Camomile, you need
OCaml >= 4.0.3
jbuilder >= 1.0+beta7
cppo
base-bytes

To build the library, on the top directory do
	$ jbuilder build
	$ jbuilder install

Data files are put under /usr/local/share/camomile by default.
The default can be overrided by running
	$ ocaml configure.ml --share=XXXX
then data files are placed under XXXX/camomile.

You can uninstall the library by
	$ jbuilder uninstall


2. Using libraries

2.1 Packing

"camomile.cma" contains three top-level modules CamomileLibrary,
CamomileLibraryDefault, CamomileLibraryDyn.  Difference of three
modules is explained below.

"camomileLibrary.cma" contains CamomileLibrary alone.
"camomileLibrary.cma" is useful if you want to dynamically load
Camomile, since loading CamomileLibraryDefault, CamomileLibraryDyn
causes side effects such as loading data files which could fail.

2.2 Configuration

Camomile requires runtime configuration.  Currently, you have to pass
the location of data files to Camomile.  In the future, more
configuration variables would be required.

Camomile's idea of configuration is "configuration by functors".
Modules which require configuration become functors parametrized by a
module which contains configuration variables.
CamomileLibrary.ConfigInt.Type specifies the module type of
configuration parameters.  You can pass the configuration module to
individual modules' Make (as UCol.Make) or Configure functors (as
CharEncoding.Configure), or pass it to the whole-in-one functor
CamomileLibrary.Make and obtain configured modules.

Camomile provides two top-level modules CamomileLibraryDefault and
which contains modules already configured.  CamomileLibraryDefault is
configured by default values determined by configure.  Therefore it is
suitable to use if you are using Camomile locally installed from the
source.  CamomileLibraryDyn is configured at runtime using
environmental variables.  Therefore it is suitable to use if you plan
to relocate data files.  Note that data files are just results of
output_value, and loaded by input_value without *Any Check of Their
Validity*.  Therefore, you should not use CamomileLibraryDyn if
a malicious user can change the values of environmental variables.
