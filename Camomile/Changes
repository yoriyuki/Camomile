From 0.8.3 to 0.8.4

* Scoping rule of "." in regular expressions is fixed to match the rule
  of Str of stdlib.  (Pointed out by Kawakami Shigenobu.)

  substring, not raises Not_found.  (Pointed out by Kawakami Shigenobu.)

From 0.8.2 to 0.8.3

* The bug that casefolding mapes lowercase letters to empty string is
  fixed.

From 0.8.1 to 0.8.2

  aliases which contain "." or "/" etc.

* Charmap tables are updated to the recent ones of glibc.

  out by Chris Kuklewicz.)

From 0.7.3 to 0.8.0

* Reorganize the module structure : Make CamomileLibrary.Default to
  the new top-level module CamomileLibraryDefault, so that linking
  CamomileLibrary does not automatically cause to load the data files
  from hard-coded location.  Also, adding new CamomileLibraryDyn
  module, which is configured by environmental variables (See
  camomileDynConfig.mli).

* StringPrep module:  String preparation according to RFC3454,
  contributed by Pierre Chambart.

From 0.6.5 to 0.7.0

* Initialization parameters for Camomile are given by Functor.

From 0.6.4 to 0.6.5

* Collation rules without headers were not compiled.  This version fix
this problem.  Collation of Scandinavia languages are now correctly
processed.

From 0.6.3 to 0.6.4

* Fix link error of the native code library

From 0.6.2 to 0.6.3

* Support OCaml 3.09.0
* Remove unpack

From 0.6.1 to 0.6.2

* Insert spaces before ] in the installation scripts of Makefile 

From 0.6.0 to 0.6.1

* Fix the bug that "get" methods of polymorphic input channels have
the type 'a, which should be unit -> 'a.

* Fix a bug which causes flush methods of octet output channels only
flush 1024*n bytes at a time.

* Remove a superfluous check from configure.

From 0.5.3 to 0.6.0

* Channel classes confirm common I/O class recommendation
(http://www.ocaml-programming.de/rec/IO-Classes.html) except
non-blocking I/O, which is not supported.
* Remove all C binding and related functions.
* Remove stdlib replacement introduced in 0.5.*
* UPervasives
  - utf8_*_channel are removed.
  - normalization mode are removed.
* UChar
  - UChar.is_printable is removed.
  - unsafe operations are removed.
  - UChar.int_of_uchar is renamed UChar.int_of
  - UChar.uchar_of_int is renamed UChar.of_int
* Locale
  - Locale.current_locale, Locale.set_locale are removed.
* CharEndocing
  - CharEncoding.enc_name is removed.
  - new classes:
	class CharEncoding.convert_uchar_input
	class CharEncoding.convert_uchar_output
	class CharEncoding.convert_input
	class CharEncoding.convert_output

From 0.5.0 to 0.5.3

* Fix several bugs in the installation procedure.
* COPYING
* UTF16, UCS4 - improved performance

From 0.4.2 to 0.5.0

* Stdlib replacement 
* Search string by matching collation
* Binding to ISO C Locale.
  - UChar.is_printable
  - Locale.current_locale, Locale.set_locale
  - CharEncoding.enc_name
* New encodings
  - iso_c_locale : the encoding specified by the current LC_CTYPE locale.
  - CP932
* Packed and unpacked libraries.

From 0.4.1 to 0.4.2

* Add bigarray to the dependency in META.
* Fix a bug in input_line function of ULine.
* Fix a XArray.add_array bug, which affects XString.add_text, 
UText.Buf.add_string.
* Make the collator a bit fast.

From 0.4.0 to 0.4.1

* CharEndocing
 - The encodings can be referred by IANA names.

* UCol
 - Japanese collation is fully supported (HiraganaQ).
 - Bugs which mainly affect Japanese collation are fixed.
 - generates more compact sort keys.

* ULine
 - Line I/O, and conversion of line separators.

* Data tables are now held through weak pointers, so that they can be
freed during GC.

* All files in charmap directory become optional.  Previously, the build
failed if several charmaps were missing.  In addition, you can remove any
file in the $DATADIR/charmaps and $DATADIR/mappings without causing 
run time error.  Of course, this makes some encoding dysfunctional.
Such encodings are treated as non-existent.

From 0.3.1 to 0.4.0

* Camomile (previously Base)
 - Renamed to Camomile.
 - USet (Unicode character sets), UCharTbl (fast lookup tables)
 - SubText

* URe, UReStr (Regular Expression) are added.

* UTF16, UCS4 (new Unicode string types) are added.

* findlib support

* ocamldoc support

From 0.3.0 to 0.3.1

* CharEncoding:
 - Bug fixes for ISO-2022-*
 - Interface for automatic detection of encodings.
 - GB18030 support
 - Improvement of internal data structure (using less space)

* UCol:
 - Incremental comparison

* Performance improvement of collation rule compiler.

	
From 0.2.X to 0.3.0

* Functor design:
API taking Unicode strings becomes functors over Unicode string
implementation.  For Unicode strings, UText.t (abstract data
type, internally integer array) and UTF8.t (normal ocaml string with
UTF8 encoding) are currently provided, but suppling another
implementation (like wch) should be easy.  For this, API is almost
completely revised.

* The locale can be specified for case mapping and string comparison.
