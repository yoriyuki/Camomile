1. Installation

The library is designed to work all platform supported by ocaml, but
currently the build procedure requires GNU tools (GNU coreutils, Make,
grep, sh).
In the top of the source directory, do the following.
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

The installation directories depend on whether you have findlib, which
is automatically detected.  If you do not have findlib, Library files
(camomile.cma, camomile.cmxa and other auxiliary files) and
interface files (camomileLibrary.cmi) are installed to ocaml standard
library directory.  If you have findlib, these files are governed by
findlib and installed as a package named "camomile".  For either
cases, data files are put under /usr/local/share/camomile by default.
If you give the configure option as
	$ ./configure --datadir=XXXX 
data files are placed under XXXX/camomile.  Also, programs
"camomilecharmap.(byte or opt)" and "camomilelocaledef.(byte or opt)"
are installed to {bindir} (a directory specified by configure).
Running commands with --help option display their usage.

You can uninstall the library by
	$ sudo make uninstall

If you have ocamldoc,
	$ make dochtml
creates dochtml directory in the source directory, and HTML
documentation.

If you use MinGW port of OCaml and put OCaml stuff into the folder
C:/OCaml, then specify prefix when invoking configure.  
	  $ configure --prefix=C:/OCaml 
The prefix must be in the MSDOS file format and separators of path
must be /, not \.

2. Using libraries

2.1 Packing

All module are packed to CamomileLibrary module, i.e. have names as
CamomileLibrary.<module name>.

2.2 Configuration

You can specify the location of data files used by camomile.  This
functionality is useful, for example, if you plan to use compiled
binary with Camomile on machines with different directory structures.

"make install" automatically installs all data files into the default
locations, which are specified by CamomileDefaultConfig module.  If
you just wanted to use default configuration, you can use
Default.Camomile module.  Default.Camomile module has *almost* same
interface to Camomile 0.6.X

To configure individual module, you have to pass a module containing
configuration values to Make or Configuration functor.  Or, you can
use Main module which defines Main.Make functor.  Main.Make functor
returns a module which contains all modules which are properly
configured.  ConfigInt.Type module type specifies what values should
be defined.

2.3 Individual modules.

See *.mli files.

2.4 Migration from 0.6.X

Replace all references to Camomile with
CamomileLibrary.Default.Camomile.  CamomileLibrary.Default.Camomile
have the *almost* same interface with the previous Camomile.

3. Development

You can checkout the development version of Camomile by the following
command. 
    $ svn co https://camomile.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/camomile camomile  

To build the development version of Camomile, you need autoconf and C
pre-processor.  Then, enter the working directory and do the
following.
    $ autoconf
    $ ./configure ...
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
