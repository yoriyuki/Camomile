# Camomile

This is the version 1.0.1 release of Camomile library package. Camomile is a
Unicode library for ocaml. Camomile provides Unicode character type, UTF-8,
UTF-16, UTF-32 strings, conversion to/from about 200 encodings, collation and
locale-sensitive case mappings, and more.

The library is licensed under LGPL-2 with the common linking exception given to
OCaml packages. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)

## Installation

To build and install Camomile, you need [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) >= 4.02.3 [dune](https://dune.build) >= 1.0.0

To build the library, on the top directory do
```sh
$ dune build
$ dune install
```
By default, the library looks for shared files copied under a directory controlled by `dune-site` and
usually located inside your `opam` switch directory. This can be overridden by running:
```sh
$ CAMOMILE_CONFIG=env CAMOMILE_PREFIX=/usr/local dune build
```
in which case, the library will look for those files at `/usr/local/camomile`

Please not that `dune` installs the file under the same local directory regardless of this option.
This option is meant to be used when packaging the library for distributions and binary packages such
as debian or ubuntu packages, RPM package etc.

You can uninstall the library by
```sh
$ dune uninstall
```

## Using libraries

### Configuration

Camomile requires a runtime configuration to be able to locate its data files.

Camomile's idea of configuration is "configuration by functors". Modules which
require configuration become functors parametrized by a module which contains
configuration variables. `Camomile.Config.Type` specifies the module
type of configuration parameters.  You can pass the configuration module to
individual modules' `Make` (as `UCol.Make`) or `Configure` functors (as
`CharEncoding.Configure`), or pass it to the whole-in-one functor
`Camomile.Make` and obtain configured modules.

Camomile provides two top-level modules which contains modules already configured.
Therefore it is suitable to use if you are using Camomile locally installed from
the source.

### Individual modules.
